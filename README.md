## This is the website for Kids Doc Pediatrics

### Pages:
1. Insurance
2. New Patients
3. Contact (this is questionable, since the footer has all the contact information)
4. Learn more (aka a team page). This is also open to discussion, considering we can just create some kind of pop-up with more info if you click learn more.

## To do:

1. Do parent resource page
1. Include Mission statement
1. Staff page
1. Format the front-page video so that it's not weird when the window gets bigger and smaller.

## Questions for doctors

1. Is "inactivated poliovirus" the offered polio vaccine
1. Do they offer influenza as the (1) live, intranasal one or the (2)inactivated one
1. Is the HPV vaccine (1) Cervarix or (2) Gardasil?
