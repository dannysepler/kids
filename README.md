## This is the website for Kids Doc Pediatrics

### Pages:
1. Insurance
2. New Patients
3. Contact (this is questionable, since the footer has all the contact information)
4. Learn more (aka a team page). This is also open to discussion, considering we can just create some kind of pop-up with more info if you click learn more.

## To do:

1. Learn More page
1. Format the front-page video so that it's not weird when the window gets bigger and smaller.
1. Look into the main page text for each page (rainbow options? color that's more visible/less intense than red.)
1. Incorporate texture background.
