## This is the website for Kids Doc Pediatrics

### Pages:
1. Insurance
2. New Patients
3. Contact (this is questionable, since the footer has all the contact information)
4. Learn more (aka a team page). This is also open to discussion, considering we can just create some kind of pop-up with more info if you click learn more.

## To do:

1. Do parent resource page
1. Include Mission statement
1. Staff page
1. Format the front-page video so that it's not weird when the window gets bigger and smaller.

## Questions for doctors

###### IMMUNIZATION QUESTIONS
1. Is "inactivated poliovirus" the same thing as the polio vaccine? Or is it a variant of it? Which does Kids Doc offer?
1. Does Kids Doc offer influenza as (1) live, intranasal or as (2)inactivated?
1. Is the Kids Doc HPV vaccine (1) Cervarix or (2) Gardasil?

###### DESIGN QUESTIONS
